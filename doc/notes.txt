structure:
- introduction:
    - spontaneous is difficult, despite dictated successful
    - spontaneous underrepresented in training data: it's tough to collect
    - they're pretty different acoustically and linguistically
    - a couple of approaches to improve spontaneous performance
    - importance of investigating these differences comprehensively
    - let's take a look at the acoustics

- related work:
    - furui, nakamura, ichiba, iwano: spectral reduction
    - hoesen: similar but specifically for Indonesian
    - model adaptation approach
    - model switching/weighting approach

- corpus:
    - source and purpose
    - overview
        - number of speakers
        - number of files
        - duration
        - speaker characteristics

- analysis:
    - general approach to analysis
    - description of workflow/environment
    - feature extraction:
        - transcripts and alignment
        - description and brief reasoning behind features
        - obtaining the features
    - differences at the phone level
    - differences at the speaker level
    - differences at the gender/dialect/age level
    - observations

- classification:
    - classifying speech segments without phone information is attractive
    - segments are a logical choice cos of length
    - feature extraction:
        - features for classification differ somewhat from analysis
        - choice of acoustic features
        - PCA/dimensionality reduction
        - combinations of features
    - classification:
        - SVM as a first choice
        - suitability of data
    - experiments and results:
        - cross validation and testing set
        - configuration and combinations
        - classification results

- conclusion and future work
